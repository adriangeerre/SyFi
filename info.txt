Hey Adrian (and Florian), I have collected the genomes and raw reads of around 10-15 isolates per Culture Collection (Lotus, Arabidopsis and Barley) as well as the two CHA0 genomes (one original, the other modified to have 2 haplotypes instead of 1). I have made a list of the isolates in 'list_2.txt' (also a list of all isolates of the SuperSynCom that I used before in the fingerprint pipeline --> list.txt). In 'info.txt' I have put which isolates have how many haplotypes and some information of the strains included. If you have any questions, let me know huh! Good luck and talk to you guys soon again Cheers, Gijs
