# Questions


I.

# Step 1:
Blast, Why not to use a database and a unique fasta file? -> Multiple genomes against a 16S (Modify gaps)
How many sequences are parsed? How many to be identified?
What is the post processing for? Obtain the 16S sequence

Example of the list?

# Step 2:
BWA maps the fasta against the R1 and R2? Use -C to get fastq information? Increase the number of threads (-t)!
Samtools want to create a BAM from a SAM? Could use threads (-@/--threads)! -> samtools view -bS {out_dir}/Illumina.sam -@ {threads} > {out_dir}/Illumina.bam
Why do you need fastq? -> For variant calling with the python script

# Optional 1
Why to assemble genomes? Aren't them already assembled?
Yaml creator in python?

# Step 3
Is there any variant caller to get haplotypes from bacteria?


# Step 7
When to discard haplotypes? When the largest is bigger that 25 (arbitrary) it is removed and keep the other. Repeat again. (Do it in R)
R for Excel

II.

16S reads that goes to variant calling are use here.

Use bedtools genomecov for the genome coverage
Sometimes genes are not found in bad quality genomes (less than 100x)
