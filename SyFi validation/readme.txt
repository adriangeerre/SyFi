The SyFi validation folder contains all the files to recreate the figures in the manuscript. The folder Rscripts contains the R code to generate and save the main figures 3 and 4, the supplemental figures S1-S7, supplemental table S5, and the figure in Appendix 3. SyFi_full.R contains all scripts together, while the other scripts are Rscripts of the individual figures or tables.

The other files and folders are called into the scripts to generate these. Downloading the entire 'SyFi validation' folder and setting the location of this folder into the working_directory line in the Rscript will allow the user to easily generate all figures. 

What the individual files indicate:
